Flask is a web framework written in Python that is used for building web applications. One common application that can be built with Flask is a URL shortener.

A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and creates a shortened version that redirects to the original URL. This can be useful for social media platforms where character limits are in place or when you want to make it easier to share long links.

To build a URL shortener in Flask, you need to create a web application that accepts a URL as input and generates a short URL that redirects to the original URL. This can be done using a combination of HTML templates and Flask routes.

One important aspect of building a URL shortener is generating a unique identifier for each shortened URL. This can be done using a hashing algorithm or by using a counter that increments each time a new URL is created.

Flask provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications, making it an ideal choice for building a URL shortener. Additionally, Flask offers a wide range of extensions that can be used to enhance the functionality of the application, such as Flask-WTF for handling forms, Flask-Login for user authentication, and Flask-SQLAlchemy for working with databases.
